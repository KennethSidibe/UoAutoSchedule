# UoAutoSchedule
python script that will automatically retrieve all the info from the screen capture of their schedule, UOttawa schedule only.

The problem is, UOttawa provides no easy way to extract your schedule easily in a smart calendar or just retrieve your class schedule in a text file. Plus, most of the students (most of my friends) will ruin their pretty lock screen to put that ugly screen capture of their schedule.

So I want to make a script that can retrieve the data from the screen capture or the pdf (the only way to get the actual text lol)
